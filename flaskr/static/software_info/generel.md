# Robot Control Information
This document provides general information about the software and describes how to properly use it.  
The software is designed to run on a **Raspberry Pi** together with the corresponding connected hardware.

The main concept of the program is inspired by **Scratch**.  
It provides a large selection of **code structures**, referred to as **blocks**, which can be **dragged and dropped** into a workspace to visually build the program that controls the robot.  
Additionally, the software offers several **manual control options** for direct robot operation.

## General Overview
![Program overview](static/software_info/images/overview.png)
The program interface is divided into several sections, each serving a specific purpose.  
A short overview is provided below. For detailed instructions on individual components, please refer to their dedicated information sheets.

### Code Block Section
![Program overview](static/software_info/images/code_block.png)
This section contains all available **code blocks** that can be used to program or control the robot.  
The blocks are organized into logical subsections:
- `Movement`
- `Measurement`
- `Control`
- `Event`
- `Constants`
- `Variables`
- `Positions`
- `Calculations`
- `Time`
- `Debug`

Further information about the individual block types can be found in the **Blocks Overview**.

### Workspace
![Workspace](static/software_info/images/workspace.png)
In the center of the interface, you will find the **workspace** (the large dotted area).  
Blocks can be **dragged and dropped** into this area to create a visual representation of the robot control program.

All blocks placed on the workspace together form the executable program, which can be started by pressing the **green button** in the bottom-left corner.  
The **red button** in the bottom-right corner clears the entire workspace.

![Delete Area](static/software_info/images/block_delete.png)
If you scroll down within the workspace, you will find a **delete area** where unwanted blocks can be dropped to remove them from the program.

## Manual Control Section
![Manual Control](static/software_info/images/manual_controls.png)
Below the Block Section and workspace is the **Manual Control Section**.  
This area allows users to control the robot directly, similar to using a **remote control**.

The robot’s **current position** is displayed, and it can be reset to its initial state using the **`Reset`** button.  
Next to the reset button, there are options to **temporarily store up to three positions**.  
This acts as a **position clipboard**, which is saved **locally in the browser** only.

---

## Console
![Console](static/software_info/images/console.png)
At the bottom of the interface is the **Debug Console**, which provides **text-based feedback**.  
This includes:
- Error messages
- System information
- User-defined debug outputs (e.g., messages generated by the **`Debug` block**)
