## Clipboard

![Clipboard](static/software_info/images/clipboard.png)

The **clipboard** allows you to **temporarily store the robot’s positions** and later **move the robot back** to one of these saved locations.  
A total of **three positions** can be stored.

Please note that these positions are stored **locally in the browser**, meaning they are **not shared or synchronized** across different devices or sessions.
